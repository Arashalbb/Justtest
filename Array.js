// An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
// It is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same data type, though JavaScript arrays can hold elements of different types.


// Example

let Employee = ["Arash", "Niloofar", "Danial"];
console.log(Employee[0]); // Arash
console.log(Employee[1]); // Niloofar
console.log(Employee[2]); // Danial
